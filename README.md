# Hubify Smart Home

This is a UI framework that I threw together overnight for a UI usability testing project, some of the CSS is missaligned but it is a rough mockup.
This is a high feasabillity prototype, meaning some of the functionallity is implemented, meaning the buttons work, but the content doesnt since it is not hooked up to anything. Below are some images of what the application looks like, should you want to play around with the website you can message me and i will send you the link.
