# Hubify Smart Home

This is a UI framework that I threw together overnight for a UI usability testing project, some of the CSS is missaligned but it is a rough mockup.
This is a high feasabillity prototype, meaning some of the functionallity is implemented, meaning the buttons work, but the content doesnt since it is not hooked up to anything. Below are some images of what the application looks like, should you want to play around with the website you can message me and i will send you the link.

#### Below are images of what the UI looks like (Should you wish to play around with the website, contact me)
Of course the website uses bootstrap, so it will resize based on screen size
 

### Main page
The page you see first

### Add New Device page
This is the page you see when clicking the "Add New Device" card, it has a dropdown menu for you to pick the device type and a name

### The TV screen, 
This is what you see when clicking the "TV" card and initially the TV is off but when the "On" button is clicked an image displays and is meant to be a stand in for a live feed, and of course the user can click "next" and "prev" to browse between "channels"

### The Thermometer
This is emant to control the thermostat and can switch between celsius and Fahrenheit, and is pretty self explanatory
